Andres' Cryptocurrencies inheritance scheme
============================================

The basic process consists of dividing a wallet's seed (12 words) into 2 of 3 chunks using the Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme:

Then use the GMail/Google account “Inactive Account Manager” feature to send the data to two different groups of people.

At least two Google accounts will be created and configured to share a folder with the required files and instructions to the different groups of people after a certain period of inactivity (N months).

The owner of the crypto assets will be responsible for maintaining all the Google accounts active (logging into them in less than N months regular basics). 

Once the owner's consciousness has dissipated into the universe, there will be no one to keep the Google accounts active, and once N months of inactivity have passed, the inheritance process will be triggered.

The data chunks needed to regenerate the seed will be stored inside a password-protected RAR file (different passwords for each group of people). 
The password will be provided beforehand to all the people on the groups, together with proper advice and training on the process.

Groups of people:
	1# Owner's close family members
	2# First inheritor family members
	3# First inheritor
		He/she will be receiving the two groups' data, so he/she can reconstruct the seed by himself.
		=> Only in the case of both owner and 1st inheritor missing, there'll be the need to be agreement between the two groups of people.

3rd chunk of data:
	# It could be stored in a 3rd Google account with a longer period of inactivity
	# Used as 1st inheritor way to access the data (instead of sending both data to she/he)
	# To be sent to a legal advisor/mediator.
	# To be sent to the owner's preferred group (likely its family)



Know issues:
	❌ You have to put the seed online. Although it is divided, protected by passwords and saved in different Google accounts, it requires a careful process of generating the RAR files, putting them online, etc.
	❌ It can be complicated to manage different stacks of assets (eg: KYC / non-KYC). The same for multiple wallets. Maybe it requieres two separate schemas. 
	✔ Relatively easy to implement (no multi-sig, etc)
	✔ Multiple assets can be supported
